Notes
=====

For Mike:
---------
- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

* * *

- "play with this" button
- reset button
- single stepping through statements
- "How do i make this come alive?"

* * *

- don't want 15 instances of the same lab
- need a way to 'link' things, per se
  - it looked like burt had something like this maybe?

* * *

#### update:
- want to make a not-full-editor version
  - branch it in git
  - take out / dumb down the interactive bits (?)

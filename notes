Notes
=====

For Mike:
---------
- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

---

- "play with this" button
- reset button
- single stepping through statements
- "How do i make this come alive?"

---

- don't want 15 instances of the same lab
- need a way to 'link' things, per se
  - it looked like burt had something like this maybe?

---

#### update:
- want to make a not-full-editor version
  - branch it in git
  - take out / dumb down the interactive bits (?)

---

### TODO
- i think the relationship name needs to be in the statement.
  - would be simple enough to add a "name" field in each action
  - just pass it to the accept bit, tada
- need a fixed-width font for the statements
- need to add quotes around text entries
  - do we also need them around tables? we'll check into that.
- *undo?*

---

- i'm betting we can take the 'remove' function out of the hist object array
  and put a single one in the $scope. we'd just need some way to get that index
  into it.

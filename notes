## Notes

- Currently, in index.html, the Relationship View is hard-coded to show the
  Select relationship. This needs to be changed to reflect the currently
  selected action.
- The tables need to finish being copied from old watson to DatabaseApp.js.
- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
   need to fetch appropriate values to pick from.
- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
  need to change when a new value is selected.

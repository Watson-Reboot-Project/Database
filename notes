## Notes

- The tables need to finish being copied from old watson to DatabaseApp.js.
- Need to add partials for project and join
- Add hover effect to table list?
- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
   need to fetch appropriate values to pick from.
- The accept and cancel buttons still need to be wired up

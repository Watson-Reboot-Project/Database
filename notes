## Notes

- Add hover effect to table list?
- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
   need to fetch appropriate values to pick from.
- The accept and cancel buttons still need to be wired up

- - -

- Something needs to be done with 'current'. having all the action values in
  the same place will lead to problems

- - -

- "play with this" button
- reset button
- single stepping through statements

- How do i make this come alive?

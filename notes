Notes
=====

For Mike:
---------
- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

* * *

- "play with this" button
- `reset` button?
- single stepping through statements
- "How do i make this come alive?"

* * *

- don't want 15 instances of the same lab
- need a way to 'link' things, per se
  - it looked like burt had something like this maybe?

update:
-------
- want to make a not-full-editor version
  - branch it in git
  - take out / dumb down the interactive bits (?)

----------
- final notes
- there's a nice walkthrough version now.
  - need to work on ease of modification
  - that separation of data and logic thing again.
- *`project` needs to be changed*
  - the output order doesn't depend on the order of the statement

NEED TO WRITE A PAPER

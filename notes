Notes
=====
- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
   need to fetch appropriate values to pick from.
- The accept and cancel buttons still need to be wired up
- The 'active' state in the list-buttons is being weird...
- *Multi-line editor?*
  - to work w/ the walkthrough
  - all the statements at once
  - **this would probably be more difficult than we want to deal with**
  - **more of a history view?**
    - b/c that's kinda what i'm doing, lol

* * *

For Mike:
---------
- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

* * *

- "play with this" button
- reset button
- single stepping through statements
- "How do i make this come alive?"

* * *

- don't want 15 instances of the same lab
- need a way to 'link' things, per se

* * *

#### the javascript lab
- infinite loop checker
- query user and such

* * *

#### update:
- want to make a not-full-editor version
  - branch it in git
  - take out / dumb down the interactive bits (?)

* * *

### Work in progress
so i'm working on the editor bit again. going to try to set up a history-like
panel. right now working on getting the buttons to stick to the bottom of the
div. didn't really find a way to do it in bootstrap, resorting to pure css.
it's pretty dumb, but it works for now.

### TODO
- i think the relationship name needs to be in the statement.
  - would be simple enough to add a "name" field in each action
  - just pass it to the accept bit, tada
- need a fixed-width font for the statements
- need to add quotes around text entries
  - do we also need them around tables? we'll check into that.

- *undo?*

## Notes

- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
   need to fetch appropriate values to pick from.
- The accept and cancel buttons still need to be wired up
- The 'active' state in the list-buttons is being weird...

- - -

- "play with this" button
- reset button
- single stepping through statements

- How do i make this come alive?
